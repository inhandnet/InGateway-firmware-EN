    - CHAP: specifies the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, a security authentication method that verifies message digests through three-way handshakes.
    - MS-CHAP: specifies the CHAP standard defined by Microsoft.
    - MS-CHAPv2: specifies the upgraded version of MS-CHAP, which requires two-way authentication.
  - Username: specifies the user name used for connection to the public data network (PDN). It is provided by your network operator. The default value is `gprs`.
  - Password: specifies the password of the PDN user. It is provided by your network operator. The default value is `gprs`.
- Dual SIM Enable: enables or disables the dual-SIM card mode.
  - Main SIM: specifies the main SIM card used. Options are SIM1, SIM2, Random, and Sequential.
  - Max Number Of Dial: specifies the maximum number of dial-up attempts on SIM1. When the number of dial-up failures reaches this number, the gateway switches to SIM2.
  - Min Connected Time: specifies the minimum network connection duration after the gateway dials up successfully. Within this duration, the number of dial-up attempts is counted. When the connection duration exceeds the set value, the number of dial-up attempts is reset. When the value is set to 0, this function is disabled.
  - Backup SIM Timeout: specifies the timeout period of the backup SIM card used currently. The gateway switches to the main SIM card when the timeout period of the backup SIM card is reached.
- Network Type: specifies a network type for the SIM card. Options are Auto, 3G, 4G, and 2G. You can select a specific network type suitable for your gateway and SIM card or choose the auto mode, in which the gateway automatically registers to the suitable network.
- Profile: specifies the index of the dial-up parameter set.
- Roaming: enables the roaming function to allow the gateway to dial up in roaming state or disables the roaming function to prevent the gateway from dialing up in roaming state. When a local SIM card is used, its dial-up capability is not affected whether this option is selected or deselected.
- PIN code: specifies the personal identification number of the SIM card. If you enable PIN code but do not set a PIN code or set a wrong PIN code, the gateway cannot dial up. A valid PIN code enables the gateway to dial up to a network.
- Static IP: enables or disables the use of a static IP address. If you select this option, specify an IP address manually. Then, the gateway obtains the specified static IP address every time it dials up to a network.
- Connection Mode
  - Always Online: indicates that the gateway stays online when it is running properly and will be disconnected and redial up only if the dial-up interface does not transmit any traffic in 30 minutes. This is the default connection mode of the system.
  - On-demand Dial
    - Data Trigger: indicates that the gateway is offline by default and will dial up automatically when data is sent to the Internet.

- ICMP Probes
  - ICMP Detection Server: specifies the IP address or domain name of the remote ICMP server to be probed. (If two ICMP servers are enabled, it is recommended that you enter the IP addresses or domain names of both servers here.) The gateway supports two ICMP servers: a primary server and a backup server. After two servers are configured, the gateway probes the primary server first. It probes the secondary server only when the number of probe retries on the primary server reaches the maximum value. If both the servers fail to be detected, the gateway dials up again and starts a new round of ICMP probe.
  - ICMP Detection Interval: specifies the interval between ICMP probe packets sent from the gateway.
  - ICMP Detection Timeout: specifies the timeout period of an ICMP probe. If the gateway does not receive any ICMP Reply packet within this period, it considers that the ICMP probe times out.
  - ICMP Detection Max Retries: specifies the maximum number of retries after an ICMP probe failure. (The gateway dials up again when the number of retries reaches this value.)
  - ICMP Detection Strict: enables or disables the strict ICMP probe mode. In this mode, the gateway does not send ICMP probe packets when its dial-up interface is transmitting data traffic. It sends ICMP probe packets only when the dial-up interface is idle.
- Advanced Settings
  - Initial Commands: specifies some AT commands used to check the module status.
  - RSSI Poll Interval: specifies the interval at which the gateway checks the signal status after dialing up successfully. For example, the interval is set to 60s. If you remove the antennas after the gateway dials up successfully, the signal strength will remain unchanged in 60s and decrease 60s later. If the interval is set to 0, RSSI polling is disabled.
  - Dial Timeout: specifies the dial-up timeout period. If the gateway fails to dial up to a network within the timeout period, the dial-up times out. In this case, the gateway checks the module status and dials up to the network again.
  - MRU: specifies the maximum receive unit, which is expressed in bytes.
  - MTU: specifies the maximum transmit unit, which is expressed in bytes.
  - Use Default Asyncmap: enables or disables the default Asyncmap.

#### 4.1.2 AAA

AAA is a method to determine who can access a server and what services they can use on the server. It is a structure used to configure three independent security functions in the same way. This structure provides the following service modules:

- Authentication: verifies whether a user has the right to access the network.
- Authorization: authorizes the user to use certain services.
- Accounting: records the usage of network resources by the user.

Note: When RADIUS, TACACS+, and local modes are all configured, they are used following the preference order of 1 > 2 > 3.

<a id="radius"> </a>

##### 4.1.2.1 Radius

The RADIUS protocol uses the client/server (C/S) model. A network access server (NAS) is a RADIUS client that transmits user authentication information to a specified RADIUS server and processes the response packets received from the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server receives users' access requests, authenticates their identities, and sends the required configuration information for users to the client. All data transmitted between the server and client is verified using a shared key. The client and server encrypt user passwords before transmitting them to each other, ensuring the security of passwords. The RADIUS service uses UDP as the transmission protocol and is often used in network environments that require high security and allow remote access.

The RADIUS parameters are described as follows:

- Server: specifies the domain name or IP address of a RADIUS server. You can set a maximum of 10 RADIUS servers.
- Port: specifies the service port number of the RADIUS server.
- Key: specifies the authentication key to be verified before a connection can be established to the RADIUS server. A client can establish a connection to the RADIUS server only if its authentication key is the same as that set on the RADIUS server.
- Source Interface: specifies the source interface of RADIUS packets.

<a id="tacacs"> </a>

##### 4.1.2.2 Tacacs+

The Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) protocol is a security protocol that enhances functions of the TACACS protocol. This protocol provides functions similarly to RADIUS and uses the client/server model for communication between the NAS and TACACS+ server. TACACS+ supports independent authentication, authorization, and accounting.

The TACACS+ parameters are described as follows:

- Server: specifies the domain name or IP address of a TACACS+ server. You can set a maximum of 10 TACACS+ servers.
- Port: specifies the service port number of the TACACS+ server.
- Key: specifies the authentication key to be verified before a connection can be established to the TACACS+ server. A client can establish a connection to the TACACS+ server only if its authentication key is the same as that set on the TACACS+ server.

<a id="ldap"> </a>

##### 4.1.2.3 LDAP

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is based on the X.500 standard but is much simpler and is customizable. Unlike X.500, LDAP supports TCP/IP. In simple words, LDAP provides centralized management of user access, authentication, and authorization. This protocol is easy to customize and supports centralized management of users and user groups, centralized information storage, setting of security and access control policies, security delegation reading, change of user rights, and other related functions.

The LDAP parameters are described as follows:

- Name: specifies the name of a user-defined server list.
- Server: specifies the domain name or IP address of an LDAP server. You can set a maximum of 10 LDAP servers.
- Port: specifies the port number of the LDAP server.
- Base DN: specifies the top of the LDAP directory tree.
- Username: specifies the user name used to access the LDAP server.
- Password: specifies the password used to access the LDAP server.
- Security: specifies the encryption mode. Three options are available: None, SSL, and StartTLS.
- Verify Peer: enables or disables peer authentication.

<a id="aaa-certification"> </a>

##### 4.1.2.4 AAA Settings

The IG902 supports the following authentication methods:

- Non-authentication (none): Users are fully trusted, and their identities are not verified. Generally, this method is not used.
- Local authentication (local): User information is configured on an NAS. Local authentication is fast and reduces the operation cost, but the amount of user information stored is limited by the hardware capacity.
- Remote authentication (LDAP): User information is configured on an authentication server. Remote authentication can be implemented by using the RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP.

#### 4.1.3 Alarm

The alarm function allows you to discover exceptions on the gateway in real time, so that you can fix the exceptions quickly. When an exception occurs, the gateway raises an alarm. You can select types of exceptions defined in the system and choose an appropriate alarm reporting way to obtain exception information. All alarms are recorded in alarm logs to facilitate troubleshooting.   
Alarms are classified into system alarms and port alarms:

- System alarms: raised upon system or environment exceptions, including hot start, cold start, and memory shortage alarms.
- Port alarms: raised upon exceptions on network interfaces, including LINK-UP and LINK-DOWN alarms.

Alarms have the following states:

- Raise: indicates that an alarm has been generated but not been confirmed.
- Confirm: indicates that an alarm cannot be solved currently.
- All: indicates all alarms generated.

Alarms are classified into the following levels:

- EMERG: The gateway undergoes a serious error that may cause a system reboot.
- CRIT: The gateway undergoes an unrecoverable error.
- WARN: The gateway undergoes an error that affects system functionality.
- NOTICE: The gateway undergoes an error that affects system performance.
- INFO: A normal event has occurred.

On the **Alarm** page, you can perform the following operations:

- Click the **Status** tab to view all alarms generated in the system since power-on.
- Click the **Alarm Input** tab to select the types of alarms you want to monitor.
- Click the **Alarm Output** tab to set the alarm notification method. By default, alarms are recorded in logs. After alarm output is configured, the system reports generated alarms by sending notification emails from the specified source email address to the specified destination email address. Generally, this function is not used.
- Click the **Alarm Map** tab to map a specified alarm type to one or multiple alarm notification methods. Two alarm mapping modes are supported: CLI (console interface) and email. To use the email mapping mode, enable email notification and specify related email addresses on the **Alarm Output** tab page.

### 4.2 Link Backup

Backup connections are often used between devices in a network environment to improve the network robustness and stability. These backup connections are also called backup links or redundant links.

<a id="sla"> </a>

#### 4.2.1 SLA

InHand SLA is implemented in the following way: 1. Object tracking: This module traces the reachability of a specified object. 2\. SLA probe: The object tracking module uses the InHand SLA function to send different types of probes to the specified object. 3\. Policy-based routing using a route mapping table: This module associates tracking results with routing processes. 4\. Static routing and tracking options.   
Follow these steps to configure InHand SLA:

1. Define one or multiple SLA entries (probes).
2. Define one or multiple tracked objects to track the status of the SLA entries.
3. Specify the action taken for the tracked object.

The SLA parameters are described as follows:

- Index: specifies the index or ID of an SLA entry, which can be manually set or automatically generated. You can add a maximum of 10 SLA entries.
- Type: specifies the type of an SLA entry. The value defaults to icmp-echo and cannot be changed. ICMP-Echo datagrams are used to check whether a host address is alive. The gateway sends an ICMP-Echo (Type 8) datagram to the destination host. If the gateway receives an ICMP-Echo-Relay (Type 0) datagram from the host, it considers the host alive.
- Destination Address: specifies the IP address to which the probe is sent.
- Data size: specifies the user-defined size of data. The valid value range is 0-1000.
- Interval (s): specifies the interval at which the gateway sends ICMP probes. The valid value range is 1-608400.
- Timeout (ms): specifies the timeout period of an ICMP probe. If the gateway does not receive the reply to an ICMP probe within the timeout period, it considers that the probe fails and sends another probe. The valid value range is 1-300000.
- Consecutive: specifies the number of probe failures for determining a link failure. If the gateway does not receive any reply after sending the specified number of probes, the SLA probe fails and the SLA state changes to DOWN. The valid value range is 1-1000.
- Life: defaults to forever (always effective after configured) and cannot be changed.

<a id="track-module"> </a>

#### 4.2.2 Track Module

The track module implements the association function together with application modules and monitoring modules. Located between application and monitoring modules, the track module shields the difference in monitoring modules and provides the same interface for application modules.   
Parameters of the track module are described as follows:

- Index: specifies the index or ID of a tracked object, which can be manually set or automatically generated. You can add a maximum of 10 tracked objects.
- Type: specifies the type of the tracked object. Options are sla and interface.
- SLA ID: specifies the index or ID of an existing SLA entry. This parameter is unavailable when the track type is set to interface.
- Interface: specifies the tracked interface. This parameter is unavailable when the track type is set to sla.
- Negative Delay: specifies the amount of time before the tracked object is displayed as abnormal after the interface or SLA state changes to DOWN. The value 0 indicates that the abnormal state is displayed immediately. The unit of the value is second.
- Positive Delay: specifies the amount of time before the tracked object switches to the normal state after fault recovery. The value 0 indicates that the tracked object switches to the normal state immediately.

<a id="vrrp"> </a>

#### 4.2.3 VRRP

The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) enables multiple routers on a LAN to function as one virtual router. A router can be virtualized into multiple virtual routers based on IP addresses of VLAN interfaces on different network segments. Each virtual router is identified by an ID. A router can be virtualized into up to 255 virtual routers.   
The interface tracking capability of VRRP extends the backup function, providing backup for not only interfaces on other routers but also other interfaces on the local router (such as an upstream interface) when these interfaces are faulty. When an upstream interface is in Down or Removed state, the local router lowers its own priority to enable another router with a higher priority in the VRRP group to become the gateway for traffic forwarding.   
The VRRP parameters are described as follows:

- Enable: enables or disables VRRP.
- Virtual Router ID: specifies the ID of a virtual router. The valid value range is 1-255.
- Interface: specifies the interface on which the virtual router is configured.
- Virtual IP: specifies the IP address of the virtual router.
- Priority: specifies the priority of the local router in the VRRP group. The value ranges from 0 to 255 (a larger value indicates a higher priority). A router with a higher priority is more likely to become the gateway.
- Advertisement Interval: specifies the interval for heartbeat packet exchange between routers in the VRRP group.
- Preemption Mode: enables the router to send VRRP Advertisement packets immediately when it finds its priority higher than the current gateway. As a result, a new round of gateway election is triggered, and the router replaces the previous gateway. Correspondingly, the previous gateway becomes a backup router.
- Track ID: specifies the index or ID of an existing tracked object.

<a id="interface-backup"> </a>

#### 4.2.4 Interface Backup

Interface backup refers to master-backup bindings between interfaces on the same device. When the main interface in a binding cannot transmit service traffic properly due to an interface failure or sufficient bandwidth, traffic can be quickly switched to the backup interface. The backup interface then transmits all traffic or shares a part of traffic. This feature improves the reliability of data communication between devices.   
The interface backup parameters are described as follows:

- Main Interface: specifies the interface currently used for traffic forwarding.
- Backup Interface: specifies the interface waiting for traffic switching.
- Startup Delay: specifies the amount of time before an interface probe is triggered. The valid value range is 0-300.
- Up Delay: specifies the amount of time before the main interface turns Up when the probe state changes from failed to successful. The value 0 indicates that the main interface turns Up immediately. The valid value range is 0-180.
- Down Delay: specifies the amount of time before the main interface turns Down when the probe state changes from successful to failed. The value 0 indicates that the main interface turns Down immediately. The valid value range is 0-180.
- Track id: specifies the index or ID of an existing tracked object.<font color=#FF0000> (If interface backup is used with the track module, the main interface does not turn Down when a probe fails.)</font>

### 4.3 Routing

Routing is a process that determines the end-to-end route of packets sent from a source to a destination. Routing works on data packet forwarding devices on Layer 3 of the OSI reference model. A router connects networks by forwarding data packets between them. When the router receives a data packet, it determines the outbound interface and next-hop IP address by searching for the destination IP address of the data packet in its routing table, and then rewrites the link-layer header of the data packet for forwarding. The router dynamically maintains a routing table to record the current network topology and updates routing information based on link information received from other routers on the network.

<a id="static-route"> </a>

#### 4.3.1 Static Routing

Static routes are manually configured. After you configure a static route to a destination address, packets destined for this address will be forwarded along this route. Generally, you do not need to configure static routes.   
Parameters of a static route are described as follows:

- Destination: specifies the destination IP address to which packets are sent.
- Netmask: specifies the subnet mask of the destination IP address.
- Interface: specifies the interface through which data packets are forwarded to the destination network.
- Gateway: specifies the IP address of the next router that data packets pass through before reaching the destination IP address.
- Distance: specifies the priority of the route. A smaller value indicates a higher priority.

<a id="dynamic-route"> </a>

#### 4.3.2 Dynamic Routing

The interior gateway protocol used in an autonomous system (AS) can be the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol or Routing Information Protocol (RIP).

<a id="rip"> </a>

##### 4.3.2.1 RIP

The RIP protocol is applicable to small-sized networks. It measures the distance to a destination by hop count, which is called metric. The number of hops from a router to a directly connected network is 0, and the number of hops to a network reachable through another router is 1. That is, the hop count increases with the number of intermediate routers. To limit the convergence time, RIP defines a metric range of 0-15. A hop count of 16 or larger is considered infinite, indicating that the destination network or host is unreachable. To improve the routing performance and prevent routing loops, RIP provides the split horizon feature. RIP can also import routing information learned by other routing protocols.

The RIP parameters are described as follows:

- Enable: enables or disables RIP.
- Update Timer: specifies the interval at which the router sends route updates. The valid value range is 5-2147483647, and the unit is second.
- Timeout Timer: specifies the aging time of a route. If the router does not receive any Update packet for a route within the aging time, it sets the metric of this route to 16 in the routing table. The valid value range is 5-2147483647, and the unit is second.
- Garbage Collection Timer: specifies the amount of time before a route is removed from the routing table after its metric is set to 16. Within the garbage collection period, RIP sends Update packets for this route with the metric of 16. If the route is not updated when the garbage collection timer expires, the route is permanently removed from the routing table. The valid value range is 5-2147483647.
- Version: specifies the version of the RIP protocol. Options are Default, v1, and v2.
- Network: specifies the first IP address in a network segment and the matching subnet mask.
- Advanced Options

  - Dead Interval: specifies the timeout period of a neighbor. If the router does not receive any Hello packet from a neighbor within this period, it considers the neighbor invalid. Two neighboring routers cannot establish a neighbor relationship if they have different Dead intervals. The valid value range is 1-65535.
  - Retransmit Interval: specifies the LSA retransmission interval. After the router advertises an LSA to a neighbor, it waits for the Ack packet from the neighbor. If the router does not receive an Ack packet from the neighbor within the retransmission interval, it retransmits the LSA. The valid value range is 3-65535.
  - Transmit Delay: specifies the delay time added to the LSA aging time (Age field) before the LSA is sent. This time is added because it takes some time to transmit OSPF packets on a link. This parameter is especially significant on a low-speed link. The valid value range is 1-65535.
  - Interface Advanced Options
    - Interface: specifies an interface.
    - Passive Interface: allows the interface to receive OSPF packets only and disables it from sending OSPF packets.

  - Netmask: specifies the subnet mask of the local network address.
  - Area ID: specifies the ID of the area where the LSA originating router is located.
- Area
  - Area ID: specifies the ID of an OSPF area.

  - No Summary: disables the route summarization function that aggregates multiple routes into one broadcast LSA. The result and biggest advantage of route summarization is a smaller routing table.
  - Authentication: specifies the authentication method used for OSPF packets. Options are simple, password, and md5.
  - Area Advanced Options - Area Range
    - Area ID: specifies the ID of the area where the OSPF-enabled interface is located.

    - ACL Name: specifies the name of the access control list used to filter routes. Only the routes allowed by the access control list can take effect.
  - Area Advanced Options - Area Virtual Link
    - Area ID: specifies the ID of an OSPF area.
    - ABR Address: specifies the interface address that the ABR uses to connect to the area. An ABR is a router that connects multiple areas.
    - Authentication: specifies the authentication method used for OSPF packets. Options are simple, password, and md5.
    - Key ID: specifies the ID of the key for MD5 authentication. This parameter takes effect only for MD5 authentication. The valid value range is 1-255.
    - Key: specifies the authentication key used for OSPF packet exchange.
    - Hello Interval: specifies the interval between Hello packets sent from the interface. The valid value range is 1-65535.
    - Dead Interval: specifies the timeout period of a neighbor. If the router does not receive any Hello packet from a neighbor within this period, it considers the neighbor invalid. The valid value range is 1-65535.
    - Retransmit Interval: specifies the interval at which the router retransmits an SLA after the LSA fails to get a response. The valid value range is 1-65535.

- Redistribution
  - Redistribution Type: specifies the type of redistributed routes. Options are connected, static, and rip.
  - Metric: specifies the metric of the redistributed route advertised by the router.
  - Metric Type: specifies the type of external routes imported to the OSPF routing table.
    - 1: indicates Type-1 external routes that are highly reliable. For OSPF, cost of a calculated external route is equivalent to the cost of an intra-AS route and is comparable with the cost of an OSPF route. That is, the cost of a Type-1 external route is the sum of the cost from the local router to the corresponding autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) and the cost from the ASBR to the destination address of the external route.
    - 2: indicates Type-2 external routes that are less reliable. For OSPF, the cost of a route from the ASBR to outside the AS is much larger than the cost of an intra-AS route to the ASBR. Therefore, in OSPF route cost calculation, only the cost from the ASBR to outside the AS is considered. That is, the cost of a Type-2 external route is equal to the cost from the ASBR to the destination IP address of the external route.
  - Route Map: This parameter is not configurable currently.
  - Redistribution Advanced Options
    - Always Redistribute Default Route: enables the router to advertise the redistributed default route after startup.
    - Redistribute Default Route Metric: specifies the metric of the redistributed default route advertised by the router.
    - Redistribute Default Route Metric Type: 1 or 2.
    - Default Metric: specifies the default metric used for route redistribution.
    - Distance Management
      - Area Type: specifies the route type. Options are inter-area or external.

The essence of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is that the communication parties never transmit the key over an insecure network. Instead, they exchange a series of data to calculate a shared key. Other parties (such as hackers) cannot calculate the key even if they intercept all the data exchanged for key calculation.

The essence of IKE is that the communication parties never transmit the key over an insecure network. Instead, they exchange a series of data to calculate a shared key. Other parties (such as hackers) cannot calculate the key even if they intercept all the data exchanged for key calculation.
  - Lifetime: specifies the lifetime of the IKE SA. The two parties negotiate another SA to replace the old one before the lifetime expires.

The sender uses a hash algorithm to calculate a digest field for an IP packet based on the fixed fields in the IP header and the IP payload. The receiver calculates the digest for the received IP packet and compares it with the digest field carried in the packet to determine whether the packet has been tampered with during transmission on the network.
    - ESP: provides all functions of the AH protocol and encrypts payload of IP packets. The ESP protocol can protect data in IP headers of IP packets.
  - Authentication: specifies the algorithm used for authentication. Options are MD5, SHA1, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, and SHA2-512.

    - SHA2-384: generates a 384-bit message digest.
    - SHA2-512: generates a 512-bit message digest.
  - IPsec Mode: specifies the IPsec encapsulation mode.
    - Tunnel Mode: adds an IPsec header (AH or ESP) outside the original IP header and adds a new IP header at the outermost layer. Then, the original IP packet is protected by IPsec as a part of payload. The tunnel mode is generally used between two security gateways. The packets encrypted by one security gateway can only be decrypted by the peer security gateway.
    - Transport Mode: inserts an IPsec header (AH or ESP) between the IP header and upper-layer protocol header. This mode retains the original IP header but changes the IP protocol field to AH or ESP, and calculates a new checksum for the IP header. The transport mode is applicable to communication between two hosts or between a host and a security gateway.
- IPsec Tunnels
  - Basic Parameters
    - Destination Address: specifies the IP address or domain name of the IKE peer. (Set this parameter to 0.0.0.0 when the IG902 acts as a server.)
    - Map Interface: specifies the interface to which the IPsec policy is applied.
    - IKE Version: specifies the version of the IKE protocol. Options are IKEv1 and IKEv2.
    - IKEv1 Policy: specifies a policy ID defined in the IKEv1 policy list.
    - IKEv2 Policy: specifies a policy ID defined in the IKEv2 policy list.
    - IPsec Policy: specifies a policy ID defined in the IPsec policy list.
    - Authentication Type: specifies the authentication method used for the IPsec tunnel. Shared key authentication and digital certificate authentication are supported.
      - Shared Key: specifies the shared key used for authentication.
      - Digital Certificate: specifies the digital certificate used for authentication. You need to import a valid certificate on the certificate management page.
    - Negotiation Mode: specifies the mode of IKEv1 negotiation.
      - Main Mode: separates key exchange information from the identity information. This mode protects identity information to enhance the security.
      - Aggressive Mode: does not provide identity authentication but meets requirements of some special network environments. The aggressive mode can be used when the address of the tunnel initiator cannot be obtained in advance or keeps changing, but both parties want to establish an IKE SA by using a pre-shared key.
    - Local Subnet: specifies the source network of the interested flow defined for the IPsec tunnel.
    - Remote Subnet: specifies the destination network of the interested flow defined for the IPsec tunnel.
  - IKE Advance (Phase 1)
    - Local ID: specifies the type of the local device's identifier for IKE negotiation.
      - IP Address: specifies the peer IP address used to establish the IPsec interface.
      - FQDN: specifies the character string used as the identifier of the local device.
      - User FQDN: specifies the fully qualified domain name used as the identifier of the local device.
    - Remote ID: specifies the type of the peer device's identifier for IKE negotiation.
      - IP Address: specifies the interface IP address that the local device uses to complete IKE negotiation and exchange identity information with the peer device.
      - FQDN: specifies the identifier string that the peer devices used for IKE negotiation. The value must be the same as that set on the peer device.
      - User FQDN: specifies the fully qualified domain name used as the identifier of the peer device. The value must be the same as that set on the peer device.
    - IKE Keepalive (DPD): enables or disables dead peer detection (DPD).
      - DPD Timeout: specifies the timeout period of a DPD probe. After the receiving end triggers a DPD probe by sending a DPD request to the peer, it waits for a DPD response. If no DPD response is received from the peer, it deletes the IPsec SA. The valid value range is 10-3600, and the unit is second.
      - DPD Interval: specifies the IPsec neighbor detection interval. After DPD is enabled, the receiving end can trigger a DPD probe if it does not receive any IPsec-encrypted packets from the peer within the DPD interval. In this case, the receiving end sends a DPD request to check whether the IKE peer is available. The valid value range is 10-3600, and the unit is second.
    - XAUTH: specifies the XAUTH user name and password.
  - IPsec Advance (Phase 2)
    - PFS: enables or disables Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), a feature that ensures security of other keys when a key is encrypted, because these keys are not derived from one another. The key used in phase-2 IPsec negotiation is derived from the key generated in phase 1. If the phase -1 key for IKE negotiation is intercepted by an attacker, the attacker may collect sufficient information to derive the phase-2 key for IPsec SA negotiation. The PFS feature prevents this problem by performing an additional DH exchange, ensuring security of the phase-2 key.
    - IPsec SA Lifetime: specifies the duration in which the IPsec SA is alive. When the two ends perform IPsec negotiation to establish an SA, the smaller value between the lifetime values set on the local and peer devices takes effect.
    - IPsec SA Idletime: specifies the maximum idle duration of an IPsec SA. If no data is transmitted within this duration after the IPsec SA is established, the IPsec SA becomes invalid. When the current IPsec SA is about to expire, IPsec negotiation is triggered to establish a new SA, so that the new SA is ready before the old SA becomes invalid.
  - Tunnel Advance
    - Tunnel Start Mode: specifies how the IPsec tunnel is initiated.
      - Automatically: indicates that the local device completes IKE negotiation automatically to set up an IPsec tunnel after the IPsec policy is applied. This mode is often used on a client.
      - Respond Only: indicates that local device only receives IPsec requests and does not initiate a connection. This mode is often used on a server.
      - On-demand: indicates that the local device completes IKE negotiation to set up an IPsec tunnel only when detecting IPsec packets on the interface.
    - Local/Remote Send Cert Mode: specifies when to send the certificate. Options are Send cert always, Send cert on request, and Not send cert.
      - Send cert always: Some IPsec services do not send certificate requests but need to receive the certificate from the peer because they do not save the certificate. For these IPsec services, you must select this option on the peer to enable the IPsec tunnel to be established.
      - Send cert on request: The local device sends the certificate to the peer only when receiving a request from the peer.
      - Not send cert: The local device sends the certificate to the peer regardless of whether the peer sends a request.
    - ICMP Detect
      - ICMP Detection Server: specifies the address of the peer host to be detected.
      - ICMP Detection Local IP: specifies the source address of the traffic to be protected by IPsec.
      - ICMP Detection Interval: specifies the interval between ICMP probe packets sent from the local device.
      - ICMP Detection Timeout: specifies the timeout period of an ICMP probe. If the local device does not receive any ICMP Reply packet within this period, it considers that the ICMP probe times out.
      - ICMP Detection Max Retries: specifies the maximum number of retries after an ICMP probe failure. (The local device restarts the IPsec service when the number of retries reaches this value.)

  - Local ID: specifies the local ID of the specified type.
  - Remote ID: specifies the peer ID of the specified type.
  - IKE Keepalive (DPD): enables or disables dead peer detection (DPD).

If no IPsec-encrypted packet is received from the peer, it deletes the ISAKMP profile. The valid value range is 10-3600, and the unit is second.
    - DPD Interval: specifies the IPsec neighbor detection interval. After DPD is enabled, the receiving end can trigger a DPD probe if it does not receive any IPsec-encrypted packets from the peer within the DPD interval. In this case, the receiving end sends a DPD request to check whether the IKE peer is available. The valid value range is 10-3600, and the unit is second.
  - IPsec Advance (Phase 2)
    - PFS: enables or disables Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), a feature that ensures security of other keys when a key is encrypted, because these keys are not derived from one another. The key used in phase-2 IPsec negotiation is derived from the key generated in phase 1. If the phase -1 key for IKE negotiation is intercepted by an attacker, the attacker may collect sufficient information to derive the phase-2 key for IPsec SA negotiation. The PFS feature prevents this problem by performing an additional DH exchange, ensuring security of the phase-2 key.
    - IPsec SA Lifetime: specifies the duration in which the IPsec SA is alive. When the two ends perform IPsec negotiation to establish an SA, the smaller value between the lifetime values set on the local and peer devices takes effect.

Note:

- Encryption algorithms used for IPsec are AES, 3DES, and DES, listed in descending order of security. The encryption algorithms with higher security are more complex and slower in calculation. Therefore, the DES algorithm can be used to meet ordinary security requirements.
- When the IG902 acts as an IPsec server, set the remote address to 0.0.0.0. Generally, this setting is used when one end uses a public IP address and the other end uses a variable address for dial-up.
- IPsec extensions are often combined with GRE to establish a DMVP or GRE over IPsec network.

#### 4.4.4 OpenVPN

In the OpenVPN architecture, when a user accesses a remote virtual address (an address of a virtual NIC, not a real address), the operating system uses the routing mechanism to send the datagrams (TUN mode) or data frames (TAP mode) to the virtual NIC. When the service program receives the data, it processes the data and sends the data to the external network through the socket. When the remote service program receives the data from the external network through its socket, it processes the data and sends the data to the virtual NIC. The application software then receives the data. At this time, a unidirectional transmission process is completed. The reverse transmission process is similar.

- Server URL: specifies the URL of the CA server. You must specify a CA server URL beforehand, so that the device can apply to this server for a certificate through SCEP, for example, http://100.17.145.158:8080/certsrv/mscep/mscep.dll.
- Common Name: specifies the general name of the certificate required.
- FQDN: specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the certificate. FQDN is the unique identifier of an entity on a network and is composed of a host name and a domain name. It can be resolved into an IP address. For example, host name www and domain name whatever.com form an FQDN www.whatever.com.
- Unit 1: specifies the name of the first organization of the certificate.
- Unit 2: specifies the name of the second organization of the certificate.
- Domain: specifies the qualified domain name of the certificate.

When a connection fails to be established, the device attempts to reestablish a connection at the specified minimum interval. It retries continuously until the specified maximum reconnection interval is reached. The valid value range is 15-60, and the unit is second.
- Max Reconnect Interval: specifies the maximum interval for reestablishing a TCP connection. When the reconnection period reaches the maximum interval, the device attempts to reestablish a connection at this interval (maximum reconnection interval). The valid value range is 60-3600, and the unit is second.
- Multi-server Policy: specifies the policy used when multiple servers are available. Options are parallel and polling.
  - Parallel: connects to all the servers specified in the destination IP address list concurrently.
  - Polling: connects to the servers in the list sequentially. If the first server is connected successfully, the device does not connect to other servers. If the first server cannot be connected, the device tries the other servers in the listed order until a server is connected successfully.
- Source Interface: Generally, you do not need to set this parameter.
- Local IP Address: specifies the IP address of the interface. Set this parameter when you select IP for the Source Interface field. You can leave this field blank.
- DTU ID: specifies the DTU ID that the device will send to the server after connecting to the server. You can leave this field blank.
- Enable Debug: enables or disables debugging logs.
- Enable Report ID: enables or disables ID reporting.
- Keepalive Interval: You need to set this parameter only when Enable Report ID is selected. The valid value range is 1-65535, and the unit is second.
- Keepalive Content: You need to set this parameter only when Enable Report ID is selected.
- Destination IP Address
  - Server Address: specifies the IP address of a server to be connected.
  - Server Port: specifies the port number of the server to be connected.

Note: You can specify a maximum of 10 destination IP addresses.

#### 4.5.2 I/O Interfaces

The relay output is ON by default. You can set the relay output status to OFF or ON, or set the OFF timer to enable relay output to turn on automatically.   
States of I/O interfaces are as follows:

- Digital Input
  - When the digital input mode is wet contact, the voltage of +10 V to +30 V maps to state 1.
  - When the digital input mode is wet contact, the voltage of 0 V to +3 V maps to state 0.
  - When the digital input mode is dry contact, the state is 1 if the terminal is connected.
  - When the digital input mode is dry contact, the state is 0 if the terminal is disconnected.
- Analog Input
  - The analog input status is determined based on the current or voltage obtained from the analog input interface.
- Relay Output
  - The default status is ON. You can change the status of a relay output interface manually. The relay output interface stays ON if you do not change its status in the Action field.
  - Action
    - OFF: turns off relay output.
    - ON: turns on relay output.
    - OFF -> ON: specifies the duration after which the relay input interface turns ON.
    - ON -> OFF: specifies the duration after which the relay input interface turns OFF.

The I/O interface parameters are described as follows:

- Digital Input
  - Mode: Options are Shutdown, Dry Connect, and Wet Connect.
    - Shutdown: disables the I/O interface.
    - Dry Connect: determines the I/O interface status based on whether the input is on or off.
    - Wet Connect: determines the I/O interface status based on the input voltage.
- Analog Input
  - Mode: Options are Shutdown, 0-20mA, 4-20mA, 0-5V, and 0-10V.
    - Shutdown: disables the I/O interface.
    - 0-20mA: indicates that the range of current is 0-20 mA.
    - 4-20mA: indicates that the range of current is 4-20 mA.
    - 0-5V: indicates that the range of voltage is 0-5 V.
    - 0-10V: indicates that the range of voltage is 0-10 V.
  - Collect Interval: specifies the interval at which the device reads the voltage or current value on the I/O interface. The value 0 indicates that the device does not reach the voltage or current value on the I/O interface.
