### 1.2 Set WAN Parameters: Connect IG902 to the Internet
  - Method 1: Connect to the Internet by SIM card
    - Step 1: Insert the SIM card. (Note: Before inserting or removing the SIM card, unplug the power cable; otherwise, the operation may cause data loss or damage the IG902.) After inserting the SIM card, connect the 4G LTE antenna to the ANT interface and power on the IG902.  

      ![](images/2020-01-21-11-14-06.png)  

    - Step 2: Choose Network > Network Interfaces > Cellular page of IG902 and select Enable Cellular and click Submit.  

      ![](images/2020-01-21-11-05-24.png)  

      When the network connection status is Connected and an IP address has been allocated, the IG902 has been connected to the Internet with the SIM card.   

      ![](images/2020-01-21-16-41-33.png)  

  - Method 2: Connect to the Internet by Ethernet  
    - Step 1: Use the Ethernet cable to connect the GE 0/1 and GE 0/2 ports of the IG902 respectively, as shown below:   
 
      ![](images/2020-01-21-11-23-29.png)  

    - Step 2: Choose Network > Network Interface > Ethernet > Gigabit Ethernet 0/1 page of IG902 to configure the IP address of the GE 0/1 port and click Submit. (When the network type is a static IP address, you need to configure the IP, subnet mask, and other information according to the site network conditions.)

<a id="enable-the-debug-mode"> </a>  

### 3.4 Enable the Debug Mode
To run and debug Python code on IG902, you need to enable IG902's debug mode.  Choose Edge Computing > Python Edge Computing, select Enable Debug Mode. After enabling, you can develop IG902 through VS Code. How to use VS Code for Python development of IG902, please refer to [Quick Start for MobiusPi Python Development](http://sdk.ig.inhandnetworks.com/en/latest/MobiusPi%20Python%20QuickStart-EN.html).  

![](images/2020-02-12-15-04-41.png)  

After the debugging mode is enabled, IG902 will start an SSH server to listen on port 222 of LAN (default IP address being 192.168.2.1). The user name and password of the SSH server are displayed on the previous web page. A random password is generated every time the debugging mode is enabled or the IG902 is restarted to ensure security.

## 4. Device Manager
The Device Manager developed by InHand supports functions such as monitoring IG902 status, remote maintenance of equipment, remote batch delivery of IG902 configuration, and IG902 batch upgrade, helping users to conveniently and efficiently manage IG902 and field devices. In order to enable the Device Manager to remotely manage the IG902 and field devices, the IG902 needs to be connected to the cloud platform. The connection method is as follows:  
Choose System Management > Device Manager, tick Enable Device Manager and configure the corresponding server address and registered account, and click Submit after the configuration is complete.  
- Server address: the address of the Device Manager. The address of the Device Manager developed by InHand is as follows:  
  - Domestic version Device Manager：`c.inhandcloud.com`  
  - Overseas version Device Manager：`iot.inhandnetworks.com`  
  - Domestic version InConnect：`ics.inhandiot.com`  
  - Overseas version InConnect：`ics.inhandnetworks.com`  
- Registered account: the Device Manager account associated with the IG902 device (if you have not registered an account, you need to register an account first)  
- Advanced settings: Contains configurations such as heartbeat interval. Generally, you can use the default configuration.  

![](images/2020-03-19-16-26-25.png)   

After the IG902 is successfully connected to the Device Manager, the status is described as Connection Accepted.

## Appendix
### Factory reset
There are two ways to restore the IG902 to factory settings: hardware factory reset and software factory reset.
- Hardware factory reset  
  - Step 1: After the device is powered on and the ERR light is off, press and hold the RESET key;  
  - Step 2: When the ERR light is always on, release the RESET key;  
  - Step 3: After the ERR light goes out, press and hold the RESET key again, and release the RESET key when the ERR light flashes; wait for the ERR light to go out, indicating that the factory reset was successful.  
   
- Software factory reset  
  
  Choose System Management > Configuration Management, click the reset button and select OK. IG902 will complete the factory reset operation by itself.
